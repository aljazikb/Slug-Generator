 Petopia Clinic

Petopia Clinic is a **basic Java project** that represents a simple prototype for a pet clinic system. This project focuses on **core Java concepts** and includes **unit testing** to validate functionality. It is inspired by a UI/UX prototype designed in Figma.

##  Project Overview

This project demonstrates:

* Basic Java programming
* Simple clinic-related logic (pets, appointments, or services)
* Unit testing to ensure code correctness

It is intended as a **learning and practice project**, not a full production system.

##  Design Prototype Reference

Although this project is implemented in Java, the system concept is based on a Figma design prototype.

##  Features

*  Basic pet clinic logic
*  Simple data handling using Java classes
*  Unit tests for core functionality

## Technologies Used

* Java (Basic)
* JUnit (Unit Testing)
* IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code


##  Unit Testing
Unit tests are written using **JUnit** to verify:
- Correct behavior of clinic methods
- Valid pet data handling

## Learning Goals
- Understand Java classes and methods
- Practice writing clean code
- Learn how to write and run unit tests
